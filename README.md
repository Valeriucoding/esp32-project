### About the project

This is an intruder detection system, when motion is detected, it lights up the led bar, and starts a countdown, if the countdown reaches 0, it will alert the user. 
The countdown can be stopped by puttin in the right code on the keypad.
Integration with the rest of the components will come soon.

This project is part of The bin and Hack Club Arcade.
